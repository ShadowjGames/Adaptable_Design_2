    <p>I am a passionate student who has dedicated his life to his dream of becoming a Game Designer. My journey began in third grade, when my inspiration came from my late father, who battled ALS. Since then, I've been immersed in the world of video game creation. In sixth grade, I started teaching my peers how Scratch worked and how to approach programming logic.

        My experience expanded in seventh grade, when I collaborated in the "Descubre-te" project with the Sabaneta mayor's office, promoting teamwork and the improvement of the municipality. Here, I had my first exposure to Unity and C#. In 2018, I expanded my skills by completing a Game Developing and Robotics summer course at Eafit, where I developed my second project.
        
        In 2020, I decided to strengthen my social and leadership skills by enrolling in a Human Resources technician. This allowed me to better understand people's intentions and how to create optimal work environments, essential skills for my future career in the video game industry.
        
        Currently, I continue my training at the UPB, leading projects related to animation, video games and interactive experiences. My dedication and passion for the gaming industry drives me to continue growing and contributing to the exciting world of video game creation.
